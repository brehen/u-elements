    title: Future-proof
    details: Invest in a solution that looks toward the future. U-elements not only meets W3C standards but also anticipates changes in assistive technology.

Plus, with easy opt-in and opt-out features, integrating or removing u-elements is a breeze. And did we mention it's lightweight, simple, and performant at just <span data-bytes="gzip"></span> (minified and compressed)?
